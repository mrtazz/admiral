python webserver admiral readme
===============================

admiral is a simple python webserver listening directly on a TCP socket.
All available URLs are stored in a hashmap, where they are mapped to the
respective methods. At the moment the following URLs are supported:

localhost:port/index    -- search engine index page
localhost:port/search   -- search URL which can be given keywords as parameters
                            keywords=keywords1+keyword2+keyword3
lcoalhost:port/sentence -- takes parameter repeat=count and shows a predefined
                            sentence count times

Startup:
=========
The webserver is started via the commandline in the form of:
./admiral.py -p PORT -f FOLDER
where PORT is the port the webserver should be ran at and FOLDER is the folder
with the documents to index for the search page.

admiral.py is started with the /opt/local/bin/python binary, which is standard
for the macports python binary on Mac OS X. For a different OS the first line
of admiral.py has to be adapted to a suitable python 2.6 binary. All other used
modules are standard python.
